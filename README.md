@todo - Add mod information, with crafting recipes, etc here.

This code is ©2014 jakimfett all rights reserved, and is licensed for use under the “Don’t be a jerk” non-commercial license.
This means that you’re free to pretty much do what you like with the mod, including but not limited to:
* Put the mod into your modpack
* Download it for personal use
* Fork the repository on github
* Modify the source to fix bugs or add features

The above usage of the mod is granted to you as long as this licence remains intact for both original and derived code. 
This licence also specifically requires that you do not try to make money off the code, derivatives of the code, compiled portions of the code, or anything having to do with the Alchemy++ mod. This specifically includes using AdFly and AdFly clones to get paid per click.
Specific exceptions may be made if, for example, you make a cool tee-shirt design based off Alchemy++ and want to sell that, or are using Alchemy++ as a "donator perk" on your server, or other normal use cases.
Ultimately, just don't be a jerk, and you'll be fine. I reserve the right to change this license at any time, although chances are I won't.
