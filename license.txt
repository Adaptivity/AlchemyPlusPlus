This code is ©2014 jakimfett (the "mod author") all rights reserved, and is licensed for use and redistribution under the “Don’t be a jerk” non-commercial care-free license.

This means that you’re free to pretty much do what you like with the mod, including but not limited to:
* Put the mod into your modpack
* Download it for personal use
* Fork the repository on github
* Modify the source to fix bugs or add features
* Concact me via Esper.net IRC if you don't understand something
* Use portions of the code as examples in a presentation
* Record portions of gameplay for display on YouTube or other video/media sites

The above usage of the mod is granted to you as long as this license remains intact for both original and derived code.

This licence specifically prohibits you from claiming the mod is yours without permission from the previous author(s).

As this is a non-commercial license, you are expressly prohibited from making or trying to make money off the code, derivatives of the code, compiled portions of the code, or anything having to do with the mod or mod code. 
This license specifically prohibits you from using AdFly or AdFly clones to get paid per click/download.
Specific exceptions may be made if, for example, you make a cool tee-shirt design based off the mod and want to sell that, or are using portions of the mod as a "donator perk" on your server, or other normal use cases. Any exemptions not listed here require permission from the mod author.

Ultimately, don't be a jerk, play nice, be polite, and you'll be fine.

I reserve the right to change this license at any time, although chances are I won't, because legalese annoys me.
